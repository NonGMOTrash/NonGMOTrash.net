			<b>september 3rd, 2025</b><br>
			i finally made an RSS feed!! it was a lot harder than i thought it would be........ i previously had no idea how RSS worked. i tried to find a service to automate it but all of them were paid. eventually i decided to just make a JS script to scan through news section's HTML and autogenerate a string of the RSS feed.... but then i realized i need it to use Node.js, so i learned that for the first time (LOL). i alsdid some (minor) updates to the site itself, like improving the bluesky post display thingy. school is going decent, but i know it's going to get worse so i'm to stay ahead of the game. next project will be a (short) video about bridget oki, and the next will be this year's state of the trash post. wish me luck!!!

			hi.............. been a while. i so long in fact that i have conquered physics, and am now back to college proper. it's been fun!! updates on here have been rather sparse because i have been working on a private project.... it's the first game i've made to have online multiplayer, and i've been banging my head against it and i'm actually starting to get it!! i originally intended to just make this game for my friends (it has a lot of in jokes, and one of my friends in nextbot-like form). getting the multiplayer to work properly has been a lot more than i bargained for, but i'm in deep now so i want to keep working until i finish (or atleast get it mostly functional) so updates will probably continue to be sparse....... i <i>do</i> want to make a thing of the month for august, but i'm not sure what yet... i'll figure something out!! wish me luck.

			i have finally finished the Drawabox summer promptathon! quite honestly, if feel exhausted and im glad it's over LOL. but don't get me wrong, it has been good. it's very hard to muster up the energy(??) to draw every day, but doing it for a week has helped me build up that strength!! not to mention, while it wasn't always fun in the momemnt, in hindsight i feel really happy...... like all summer i've been telling myself that i really need to draw, but, .... now i actually am! pretty cool. um, on the flipside, i am actually so behind in my summer class it's not even funny (okok, maybe it is...heh). i've spent the past week basically just drawing ((and procrastinating))!!!!! so, uh, for the immediete future i've gotta get back on that. afterwards, though, i wanna maybe get back to writing... and maybe something else? we'll see. wish me luck!!!

			<b>june 14th, 2025</b><br>
			long time no see!! well, it's been about 2 weeks... feels like a long time. unfortunately, though, i don't have much to report as i've done basically nothing during that time :(((( well, sort of... see, i've been busy! first, deltarune chapters 3+4 came out (this is a big event for me), i got a little (not real) job for a bit, and i started summer classes at community college. that last one is the biggest, i'm taking physics: mechanics and even though i've taken <i>2</i> physics classes already in highschool, it's kinda kicking my butt a little bit but i'm enduring. i like mechanics a lot more than just plain old math because it feels actually applicable to game dev.... i mean for action games, game programming is really just moving things in cartesian plains. part of why i've been having trouble is because i didn't start actually taking good notes until long after i took those clases, so most of my knowledge has faded. but, i'm not gonna let that happen again!!<br>
			anywho though, with the pretty massive workload, i'm once again faced with the dillema that has plagued me the past 3 years or so: work on school.... or work on vibeogamez (and other projects)??? so far i have no balanced these two well, or... at all, actually, as school as completely taken over. no more!! i am going to commit once again to working on my projects for a minimum of 2 hours every day, just as i did back at college (away from home), even if it sacrifaces my grade a little bit. i can take it !!!<br>
			one last thing, i started playing the piano a little bit. don't think it's something i will keep up with regularly - this isn't even my piano (ᵕ-ᴗ-) - but i had fun with it. enjoy!<br>

			<b>may 27th, 2025</b><br>
			things have been really coming to a head this last week or so, as multiple big projects have finally been completed all at once. first, i completed V2 of this website after ~7 months of work.... which is a crazy amount of time!! regardless, i'm happy to have it done, as i quite like this layout and i think i'm going to stick to it for a long time. i know a lot of people that <i>constantly</i> redo their whole site... i'm not gonna be one of those people! outside of small changes and additions to the <a href="../links/index.html">links page</a>, expect much less focus on this site. additionally, i've finally finished Drawabox lesson 1!!! i'm quite happy, even if it took me 1.5 years to do what most people complete in just a month or two... it kinda sucks looking at it that way, but 1) most people aren't practicing like 4 disciplines at once like i am, and 2) most peope don't complete lesson 1 at all! besides, there's really no such thing as "too slow" when it comes to learning... these things just will go how they go. last, i've fallen behind the "thing of the month" as working on the website overhaul + finals took up all my time, so i didn't have anything for april. i've just now made up for this with a new (short) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j2pL5EmFzc">video</a>, so i'm back on track!<br>
			now, i'm at a bit of a crossroads where i get to switch up what i'm working on. i've decided that resuming blood red harmony is a must, since it's been so long and i want to get back into writing. however, i also want to take another stab at making a small game in C++ like i've been saying i will since forever. i learned a lot in my computer sciences classes so i think i'll be a lot better equipped to now than i've been in years past. anywho, wish me luck!
		</p>

			<b>april 29th, 2025</b><br>
			i've made the executive decision: the thing of month for april will be the completion of the website overhaul. i've been at this thing since <i>october</i>... looking back, it feels like i've done a ton but also very little? i suppose it just didn't feel like a real project since it's "just my website," even though i've already written ~2x the HTML+CSS+JS that i did last year. i really wanna try to finish up so i can shift my focus to blood red harmony chapter 2(?), or other projects. however, i'm near the finish line!! the main things left on the docket are:<br>
			- adjust homepage layout on mobile<br>
			- finish links page (styling, add more links)<br>
			- fix about page polaroids on mobile<br>
			- add the actual content to the gallery page<br>
			- adjust countdown<br>
			- buy domain and publish to nekoweb<br>
			that's not <i>too</i> far off, but it's definitely not happening in april obviously, especially bconsidering i have to keep up my work on Drawabox and my drawing practice (both of which have been kinda neglected recently!) my goal is to finish it by around mid may. i'm also kinda struggling to keep up with my uni work right now, finals are approaching and im scared .o_o. wish me luck

			<b>april 1st, 2025</b><br>
			gahh!! i really wanted to do something for april fools but i honestly can't think of anythingggg...... last year i did the "i am an idiot" video, and i wanted to make a sequel called "2 many idiots" (get it) but it never soldified, i just couldn't think of any ideas for it really beyond the name..... and now i cannot think of what to make!! grrr. wait. wait. as im typing this i just thought of a really good idea. oh my god. ok bye

			<b>march 13th, 2025</b><br>
			it feels like it's been, like, 3 weeks since i last wrote in here but it turns out it's only been 9 days. time flies i guess. i have been very very sad this past week because i have basically dedicated my life to calculus. i'm in calc 2 rn (i'm in the US. if you're unfamiliar, it's basically integration techniques: the class) and it's kicking my butt :((( my proffesor is really good, has a PhD and all that so in a way i'm very lucky... but the subject matter is just so so difficult. i have been studying like 3-5 hours every day since sunday. oof. so yeah i haven't really worked on this site or drawabox in a <i>minute</i>. good news is, my midterm (the thing i've been studying so much for) is tomorrow. tbh i still think there's like a 50% chance i fail despite all my effort :') integration applications are easy sauce but the techniques, especially integrals with trig functions or that require trig substitutions.... god. it's been such a struggle. my professor says US students usually are really terrible at algebra, and i believe him. i swear i have no -- and i mean absolutely zero -- recollection of partial fractions. i think i first learned that only 2 years ago, but i completely forgot &gt;.&lt; but whatever. all i can do is try my best, so i'm not going to stress about it. even if i fail i can always retake the class and it will be a much easier since it's all review.<br>
			oh! i got distracted.... i wanted to talk a little about what i've been working on for the website. the biggest thing is that i have rewrote many of the articles in the "writings" section. some sections have been expanded or reworded, and most of all, i made the decision to change (most) articles to use proper capitalization. sounds funny, but this was unironically a very tough decision. i really like the "tone" of lowercase text... might sound like nonsense, but idk, it just gives me "good vibes". however, i realize that for something that's more serious and trying to be persuasive (like my game design articles), it really just doesn't fit. so i've capitulated. i have decided to keep the posts in the "introspective" category in all lowercase because i think it fits the tone of those better. also, i made a JS script to automatically generate a document outline for each article page! pretty niffty, i'm proud of it. i've also mostly implemented the gallery page, although the actual images aren't in there. i mostly only have old sketches right now, but they are back at home so i can't take pictures of them. that page is also a bit unstyled... but i honestly don't know what to do with it!!! maybe it will look less boring when i add the pictures. i was thinking about making a "thumbnail" system to reduce the load time. i've seen some artists that do that with their gallery but.... i have no idea how and i'm not sure i have enough artwork to justify it yet, so i think it's fine for now.<br>
			as for the immediate future, tomorrow is my last day of classes before spring break, which will be nice. i will probably study some more calculus (💀) and i want to spend more time with my friends from home, but i hope to lock in on my personal projects more as well to make up for this week. a big part of that is going to be finding a study spot. i have realized that i work 2x as efficiently when a dedicated work spot compared to in my room... my university library is good for that but i need to find a equivalent place in my home town that's open late. so i'll have to explore around.... it'll be fun :) i feel bad for having neglected blood red harmony for so long but that's just how it goes, i wanna at least finish the website overhaul before i get back to it, and even then..... agghhhh idk. i'll see how i feel.<br>
			oh wow this turned out way longer than i realized o.o see ya

			<b>march 4th, 2025</b><br>
			this happened two days ago but i've been very very busy and so i haven't gotten around to writing here until today. for feburary i decided to take a stab at trijam and made a very..... uhhh... "interesting" game. i think the concept might have some potential though? not sure. if you're reading this rn, please go <a href="https://nongmotrash.itch.io/over-over">play it</a> and give me your opinion, i would really appreciate it!! i'm going to give it some time to decide wheither or not i like it enough to make into a full game. in the meantime, i need to lock in on homework (improper integrals are kicking my butt), but spring break is this month so i will probably have a higher output during that time, hopefully. but for the immediate future, things will be difficult... but i will try my best as always. i have been doing a pretty decent job getting back into drawing. since i took quite a long break from Drawabox (~4 months), what little skills i did have are quite rusty and i forgot many things, but i've gone through all the material again and have almost finished doing my "derusting" warmups. from there, i'm actually only 3 pages away from completing lesson 1!! that will be nice. hopefully the TA doesn't notice it took me 9 months to do what most people do in 1 .o_o.\\ but whatevs. i'm not here to impress anybody, just trying my best to get better, as always. wish me luck!

			for the feburary thing of the month, i've decided that i'm going to take a stab at <a href="https://itch.io/jam/trijam-311">Trijam</a> this weekend! i'll be making my game on sunday, so it technically won't come it in feburary, but i'm still counting it as this month's release.

			<s>i haven't made the thing of the month yet for january because i have been very busy with school, i think i will be able to get to it on tuesday though. dame un momento!</s><br>
			i eventually decided to just post a funny guilty gear clip i already had since i don't really have time to make anything substantial (i mean i <i>did</i> for GGJ, i just can't post). not much but it's something hehe

			<b>january 27th, 2025</b><br>
			i did global game jam! however, i've decided that it's not really something i want to share publicly. i made it with a team i met, which was a great experience, but because of that it doesn't feel exactly right to call it "mine". not to mention, it has our REAL names on it........ scary... unspeakable! i can't have you non-existant readers figuring out who i am :3 so i've decided that i am going to make something very very small for the january thing of the month. i will be juggling classes at the same time, so it'll be tough -- but i'll try my best.

			<b>january 21st, 2025</b><br>
			i'm back to college now. my schedule is quite a bit heavier than last semester, so i'm not going to have as much time to work on my projects but i'll try my best. on the bright side, one of those classes is a digitial art class, which i'm pretty excited for. once i started college in august, my art output kinda just... stopped. so i think that will be a good way to get back into it. just ordered a (cheap) drawing tablet :3 i still want to continue with DrawABox at some point, but probably not this semester. i can already tell i am not going to have any time &gt;.&lt; i've pretty much been exclusively working on the new version of the site, but i'm still only about half way done i'd say. however, i'm planning to participate in global game jam this weekend so whatever i make for that should be my project of the month.<br>
			that's all, cya next time

			<b>january 1st, 2025</b><br>
			holy crap!!! i totally forgot about this page........ in fact, i forgor about it so hard that i didn't even push the post below i made until just now.... and the "secret jam project" (drillmonger) still says 5% complete........ ima dumb dumb sometimes &gt.&lt it's ok though. but let's talk about what's happened, and the future!<br>
			first, i ultimately decided to scrap the omori rebalance mod for good after i discovered <a href="https://mods.one/mod/overcharged">OMORI : Overcharged</a> which has a similar objective. my mod would still be a <i>little</i> unique bc no leveling, but i don't think it's enough to justify all the work. better to just make an original game, i say. i also started on blood red harmony chapter 2, though i've written very little. i also did some more work on the overhaul of this site... i feel like i've made decent progress, but i'm still not even done with just the homepage (which to be fair, is easily the most complicated page, but still). i've been chipping away at it though. once it's done, i plan to migrate to <a href="https://nekoweb.org">nekoweb</a> and buy a domain. in the meantime, you better not steal nongmotrash.net away from me!!<br>
			anywho, it's the new year! (not anymore.... i took too long to write this). i have resolutions!!!!!
			<img src="january_1st.png">
			yep yep. obviously not all those are project related...... but i think that should give you a good idea of where im headed! but for the immedieate future im gonna try to knock out the website overhaul and bloodred harmony chapter 2. im still on winter break for most of january, so i might be able to finish at least one of those before the end of the month!! we'll see. also, i'm planning to participate in global game jam!! that'll be fun, i hope.........<br>
			happy 2025!

			<b>december 6th, 2024</b><br>
			hi. i've long since pasted the point of no return on the "weekly" progress log, and after thinking about it, i decided that i actually am okay with that. i didn't forget about my projects during that gap, in fact, i actually got quite a lot done (first new game in 2 years)! the original reason i switched to a <i>weekly</i> log instead of <i>daily</i> was because i felt that daily was too often and i ended up writing a log of "dead logs" merely out of obligation that didn't really help me. but, well, i've kind of realized that the weekly system has the same problem. i think the root of the problem isn't the time interval, but how i force myself to write even if i don't have anything i want to say. well, i do now.<br>
			when i originally started this progress log thing in january, i said that i wanted pressure, that i needed it for discipline, but i'm not so sure anymore. letting go of this "ok, heres what i did this week!!!!" mantra and taking a break from the logs, honestly, was pretty nice... and i think i've been more productive too. this is a passion project, so why let all this "discipline" get in the way of that passion? that's where i'm at right now at least. so, for the foreseeable future, expect a log mabye just every month or two, whenever i feel like it -- i think i'll like this low-pressure way of doing it much better, but time will tell. see you then!

			<b>WEEK 8 (november 4th -> 10th)</b><br>
			i'm writing this update pretty late........ since saturday, i have been very unproductive. i <i>have</i> worked on the jam game, but only a very small amount, and i definitely need to do better. got distracted by acrane as well as looking at apartments ;-; but the good news is, i still have quite a bit of time. i might try to simply my initial idea a bit.... wish me luck
		</p>

		<p class="entry"><i>
			i sort of lost my groove on journaling for weeks 6 & 7, which is why there's been such a huge gap in the logs. but i'm trying to get back into it this week. overall i made some good progress on a secret project, but i didn't end up doing the raylib NEXT jam because i was busy with that, and schoolwork. college has kept me a bit more busy as i have finals coming up. i'll manage though!!!
		</i></p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>WEEK 5 (october 14th -> 20th)</b><br>
			i did pretty awful this week. i only worked ONE (1) day.... that's pretty bad. i was supposed to try and make the 'thing of the month' this week but i didn't even start. i think i've gotten maybe a bit too caught up in college life, and i need to try and get back to a consistent daily output.
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
		<b>WEEK 4 (october 7th -> 13th)</b><br>
			i feel like i simultaneously worked a decent amount and also got nothing done this week. i feel like it just comes down to working on hard things: i spent a lot of time drawing art for v2 of the website and working on the game, but the truth is i don't know how to use c++ so it's just natural that things are going to take longer. im learning. i could have worked more at times, but honestly i think i'm doing <i>okay</i>. i do need to figure out a thing of the month for october though............... maybe another article, i think one on copyright might be interesting. not 100% sure yet, but in any case i'll try to get that done this week.
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>WEEK 3 (september 30th -> october 6th)</b><br>
			i only worked on project zeta for i think one day???? but it was a very solid day so i guess this is an improvement -.- spending time in the library was definitely useful, i just ended up spending it more on homework and less on the game, sadly.... my college offers a game design course, and i was thinking about adding a minor in it to maybe merge my school studies and independent studies together, but idk. all i can do is keep trying.
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>WEEK 2 (september 23rd -> 29th)</b><br>
			overall my productivity this week has been pretty poor due to a combination of homework and parties happening at my dorm. but next week should be much lighter on both so im hoping to make some more progress. aside from just being busy, the library was also closed for most of the weekend, so i couldn't go to it to try and focus like i was planning.<br>
			as for my actual work, what little was done, mostly came done to just inching towards getting a playable version of project zeta. but i do want to emphasize it is <i>small</i>, and i'm still quite a ways off. i only worked 2/7 days //.\\<br>
			overall i've found this 'weekly report' schedule to be a lot less stressful, but i have found myself missing some benefits of the more task oriented system i had before. going forward into the next week, i want to try and set a goal for the beginning of the day and try to meet it.
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>WEEK 1 (september 17th -> 22nd)</b><br>
			this week was kinda a struggle. i think i only worked 2 -3 days..... i did work a bit more here and there on the other days but it was too short to accomplish anything meaningful. project zeta hasn't really made much progress..... at least i updated the links page on the website lol
			one good thing i did do was set up my notes with obsidian, synced between devices. i think this has been long overdue. i think part of the reason why it feels like i can't remember anything is just that i don't take notes....... so being able to have a good setup for it will help a lot. point in case: one night i had a very vivid dream that i realized was actually a good idea for a setting, and i was able to record it before it was lost. for awhile i've sort of felt like i struggled with "creativity" at times, and i think this will help a lot. 
			i think my lack of productivity mainly came down to just kinda getting distracted by fun stuff... i went home for the weekend, and wanted to spend most of that time with friends and parents so... y'know. it isn't bad, but it might be good to go to the library ocasionally so i can work in a focused session. most of my library time currently is eaten up by homework.
