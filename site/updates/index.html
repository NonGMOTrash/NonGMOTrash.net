				i realized that i literally forgot to move the old logs into an archive page until just now 2 months later 🫠. that's ok. uhh, i have been a bit unproductive TBH, most of my time is just been going to schol... kind of. i put in a lot of work on my secret multiplayer project, trying to get a major milestone done in time for halloween... i thought i succeeded, but then upon actually testing it with people i realized that it was actually still very broken. still, i made some progress so i will take a break for a while.<br>
				in other news, my art class has seriously been kicking my butt. i still really really want to get better at drawing and that hasn't changed but..... MAN, it honestly feels very painful to draw rn (emotionally). i always procrasinate that class's assignments until as long as possible because i just..... agh!!! being bad at something u really wanna be good at sucks. at least for me. i wish i drew more when i was younger and as self concious... i think that's part of why im (comparatively) good at programming now. but i really need to jsut get over myself.... plenty of people learn things when they are like, OLD old y'know???? so if they can do it, my baby self DEFINITELY should be able to do it. i think it's just a little more stressful when it's #1 for a grade and #2 always surrounded by people who are way better than me. but that's okay... i know it is... i just need to really internalize it. also another problem for me is that that class is at 8 in the morning which... realistically i know is not that bad but i looooooove sleeping in and i just can't with that class. i have slept through it i think 3 or 4 times now.... including today....... i'm sorry ms teacher!! so many things about that class stress my out... but i will endure.<br>
				one thing about that class that has been going really well is friends. i wanted to meet more people in the animation major since last year i knew like literally only 1 person (and not that well). now this year we have that art class together, so i got to talk to them and everyone they know more... i (kinda) have like a second group of friends now its so awesome !!!<br>
				as for personal projects, i've worked a bit on the C++ game (taking longer than expected) and more so on the bridget mix video (taking WAAAAY longer than expected oh my god!!! this was supposed to be done like weeks ago 😭). trying to lock in. also for this website: i originally wanted to draw new cover art on the home page every state of the trash post but i've been pretty behind on that. maybe i could pivot and instead do it for the new year? that might be cool. anyways, i gotta get back to work, byebye!!

				daaaaang it has been a long while since i wrote in here!! i have been working hard... school has been kicking my butt as usual but it's actually been pretty great. i've basically started a "strategy" (if u wanna call it that) where i'm trying to do as little work in my "BS" classes (biology, statistics, and databases) as possible so i can focus on what i perceieve as being actually important, my DSA class and storyboarding class. it's been a struggle but it's been nice since i have been able to draw and program almost every day, which is really good. as for projects, i have been making a game in C++ again but progress has been slow since i'm still learning many things... but smoother than last time i tried this. i will work on it more!! well, i <i>will</i> after i finish this darn video! it's trying to show how reactable bridget mix is in guilty gear strive... i thought this would only take me a few days but it looks like it's gonna be closer to like over a week!! i'll vent a little: in order to measure if the mix is reactable (you'll understand when u see the video) i need to have clips of both options (overhead vs low) and play them side by side so you can see when the difference appears... problem!! my recordings were <i>always</i> slightly desynced. i looked into my editting (wasn't the problem), the gameplay itself (was part of the problem, i was accidentally delaying some things by a few frames, throwing off the timing), but still things were desynced. grrrrr!!! as it turned out, my recording software itself (nvidia) would sometimes drop frames OR it would duplicate a frame. i tried using both davinci resolve and FFmpeg to automatically trim these duplicate frames, but both were inconsistent and i realized it wouldn't be able to detect skipped frames. so the solution... was to manually go frame by frame of every clip i use, CAREFULLY inspecting them to see if there's any errors, and manually removing duplicate frames or inserting extra frames to fill the space of where a dropped frame should have been. it's a pain, and required me referencing frame data to make sure the total durations of moves in my clip match what they should be, but i've got a good system for it now! only a small portion of the video is done, but i expect the rest to go much smoother now that i've got that sorted. look forward to it in maybe ... uhh... a week or so?? idk. wish me luck!!
