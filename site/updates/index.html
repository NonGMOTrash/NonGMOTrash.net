				daaaaang it has been a long while since i wrote in here!! i have been working hard... school has been kicking my butt as usual but it's actually been pretty great. i've basically started a "strategy" (if u wanna call it that) where i'm trying to do as little work in my "BS" classes (biology, statistics, and databases) as possible so i can focus on what i perceieve as being actually important, my DSA class and storyboarding class. it's been a struggle but it's been nice since i have been able to draw and program almost every day, which is really good. as for projects, i have been making a game in C++ again but progress has been slow since i'm still learning many things... but smoother than last time i tried this. i will work on it more!! well, i <i>will</i> after i finish this darn video! it's trying to show how reactable bridget mix is in guilty gear strive... i thought this would only take me a few days but it looks like it's gonna be closer to like over a week!! i'll vent a little: in order to measure if the mix is reactable (you'll understand when u see the video) i need to have clips of both options (overhead vs low) and play them side by side so you can see when the difference appears... problem!! my recordings were <i>always</i> slightly desynced. i looked into my editting (wasn't the problem), the gameplay itself (was part of the problem, i was accidentally delaying some things by a few frames, throwing off the timing), but still things were desynced. grrrrr!!! as it turned out, my recording software itself (nvidia) would sometimes drop frames OR it would duplicate a frame. i tried using both davinci resolve and FFmpeg to automatically trim these duplicate frames, but both were inconsistent and i realized it wouldn't be able to detect skipped frames. so the solution... was to manually go frame by frame of every clip i use, CAREFULLY inspecting them to see if there's any errors, and manually removing duplicate frames or inserting extra frames to fill the space of where a dropped frame should have been. it's a pain, and required me referencing frame data to make sure the total durations of moves in my clip match what they should be, but i've got a good system for it now! only a small portion of the video is done, but i expect the rest to go much smoother now that i've got that sorted. look forward to it in maybe ... uhh... a week or so?? idk. wish me luck!!
